        In many years of work as a software engineer I have designed many systems that

        I create and work with the entire stack for applications; from complex back-end systems
        to beautiful apps made to be used <strong>as little as possible</strong>.`

Whenever appropriate, I aim to design user interfaces that are meant to minimize the amount of time the user spends using them.",

        backendText: "It's always difficult to choose the tooling that will provide maintainability and scalability for the entire lifetime of your app. My experiences have helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of how various systems scale, and in which scenarios they excel. I frequently deal with Node.js, Java, and Python backends for web apps, and am familiar with how to deploy them in a scalable fashion."
